The code implements the walking algorithm of A 6 legged Hexapod which is controlled via PC using serial RS232 port.

This walking algorithm should be capable of providing walking actions like forward , backward, right left and rotate.

In future the plan is to implement a self learning algorithm which would learn to walk without a preprogrammed algorithm.
